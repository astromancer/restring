    """
    Context manager for doing file operations under backup. This will backup
    your file before any read / writes are attempted. If something goes terribly
    wrong during the attempted operation, the original content will be restored.


    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : str or Path
        The file to be edited.

        File mode for opening, by default 'w'.
    backupfile : str or Path, optional   
        Location of the backup file, by default None. The default location will
        is the temporary file created by `tempfile.mkstemp`, using the prefix
        "backup." and suffix being the original `filename`. 
    exception_hook : callable, optional  
        Hook to run on the event of an exception if you wish to modify the
        error message. The default, None, will leave the exception unaltered.
      
    Examples 
    -------- 
    >>> Path('foo.txt').write_text('Important stuff')
    ... with safe_write('foo.txt') as fp:  
    ...     fp.write('Some additional text')
    ...     raise Exception('Catastrophy!')           
    ... Path('foo.txt').read_text()
    'Important stuff' # original content was restored. Catastrophy averted!

        The type and message of exceptions raised by this context manager are
